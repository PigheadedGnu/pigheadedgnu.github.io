Forge - mod support.
	http://www.minecraftforge.net/

	Minecraft Forge is a Minecraft API which allows almost maximum compatibility between other Forge mods. It contains a clean room rewrite of RML (Risugami's Modloader) which allows compatibility with modloader mods. It contains hooks into the base Minecraft files that allows modders to make their mods more advanced without editing base classes.

CraftBukkit - plugin support.
	http://bukkit.org/

		What is Bukkit?

		Bukkit is an open-source and completely free Minecraft server modification that provides developers with the tools they need to extend the functionality of the standard Minecraft server. Through the creation of programs known as plugins, developers have the ability to add, remove or change Minecraft functionality at will. These modifications can range from admin tools that make managing a Minecraft server easier to adding entirely new features to the Minecraft server. As well as providing these tools (which are an API for plugins to be built upon), the Bukkit server often contains improvements, optimisations and bug fixes on top of the Minecraft server provided by Mojang.
		There are two important aspects of the Bukkit project: Bukkit and CraftBukkit.
		Bukkit is the API with which plugins are developed, while CraftBukkit is a modified Minecraft server with the Bukkit API included inside of it in order for Bukkit plugins to be able to run on it. If you're looking to run a server, CraftBukkit is what you'll want to run. If you're looking to develop plugins, you do so using Bukkit.

Spigot - performance optimizations.
	http://www.spigotmc.org/

		How does it work?
		Believe it or not, Spigot is just a modification of CraftBukkit, yet more efficient. It is a huge collection of various tweaks to help increase performance, and make it more flexible as a server. Not only that, this project may also be the source of zero-day patches designed to fix critical issues before they are applied to the mainline CraftBukkit.http://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/about-spigot/

MCPC-Plus
	MCPC-Plus is a brand new server that integrates Spigot into Forge allowing use of Bukkit plugins with forge mods.
